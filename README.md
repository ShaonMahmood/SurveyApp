# Project Title

A simple survey application powered by django

## Description

This project is based on the following requirements. 
* Create a SURVEY app in Django that will hold questions of three types: 

  - Text field type question
  - Radio type question
  - Checkbox multiple select
    
* Admin will be able to set up a survey, itâ€™s questions, offered answer choices and a timer (for example 5 mins or 30 mins).
* No need to create any user management forms like login/logout etc. 
* For now the participant can login with the admin login form then can directly visit the url containing the survey list and can start a survey. (Only logged in users can see the survey list and participate in a survey).
* Ensure one user can participate in the survey only once.
* For each user when participating in the survey, create a survey session for that user and record answers & questions under that session so that the admin may review the survey later.
* During the survey the user should be able to navigate back and forth between the questions and change answers. 
* Show a timer anywhere in the survey and after the timer ends, end the survey immediately.
* Use bootstrap 4+ and any type of JS libraries or frameworks (jQuery should work fine alone). Just make a basic design for the app.

All the requirements are addressed accordingly.
